This is a project using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. 
The Rate My Professor AI Assistant serves as an excellent example of RAG in action, demonstrating how to leverage external knowledge bases to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

The Rate My Professor AI Assistant demonstrates how to combine the vast knowledge of a large language model with specific, up-to-date information stored in a vector database. This approach allows us to create an AI that can understand and respond to complex queries about professors and courses, while drawing upon a curated dataset for accuracy and relevance.

RAG-based application using cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, React, Pinecone, and the OpenAI API.
